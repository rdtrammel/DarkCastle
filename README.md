# This Game
| My dad and I have been talking about making a game for years, and now that the web has become such a robost platform, I'd like to do an all web based game based on an old favorite. "Dark Castle"
| For anyone who is unfamiliar with the game, it's a simple platformer with a few obstacles. The only thing you have is your ability to run, and a sack of rocks to throw. 
- I think it's time to remake it using an old character of mine. I'm putting it up as opensource because I'll be writing in a language that I'm only 2 years proficient with. Maybe you guys can help us.
